    <h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>I am a software developer. My first experience with code was BASIC on an Apple IIe
somewhere around 1990, when I was in my early years at elementary school. I didn&rsquo;t
get into it more seriously until I was older, had spent some years in Germany,
earned a B.Sc. in Chemical Engineering, and was forced to finally ask myself
what I wanted to do with the rest of my life when the economy crashed in 2008. I
was able to pivot from Chem. E. to a Ph.D. program in Scientific Computing at the
University of Utah. Somewhere along the way, I decided I was far more interested in
writing software professionally than academics so I quit the program and managed to
convert my credits and research to that point into a M.Sc. in Computing. My focus was
computer graphics and scientific visualization.

    <h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played the guitar more or less consistently since I was 14. Aside from a few lessons
here and there, I&rsquo;m self taught. Like my journey through my career, my journey through
music has been a joy. In my teens, I worshipped the Dave Mathews Band and took a lot of
inspiration from Dave&rsquo;s guitar work. In my twenties I shifted somewhat to learning the
styles of players like Mike McCready, David Gilmour, Jimmy Page, Eric Johnson, and other guitarists with
what I felt had more interesting techniques. While I don&rsquo;t expect to ever reach any significant
level of cultural influence musically, I like to think I have gained a much deeper appreciation
of the greats through study. More recently, I&rsquo;ve been studying the piano through Bach&rsquo;s Well Tempered
Clavier, Beethoven&rsquo;s Für Elise and Moonlight Sonata, and Debussy&rsquo;s Claire de Lune.
