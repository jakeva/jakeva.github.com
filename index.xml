      <description>Shanghai and Suzhou #  Shanghai is, of course, amazing. We also took some time to visit a small (for the chinese) nearby town called Suzhou. Incredible beauty and history.

      <description>Beijing #  Beijing is huge. I mean… just huge. There&amp;rsquo;s really no other way to put it. Everywhere you go, everything is overwhelming. From the size of the buildings to the number of people. It was here that I ate a roasted tarantula on a $500 dare from my brother. I should mention my dad at one first. So I knew it was safe.

      <description>Chengdu #  Chengdu felt a little more less overwhelming. Still a much larger city than most people in the United States would be used to, but we stayed in an area of the city that could have been mistaken for Chicago, except with everything written in Chinese. And everyone around is Chinese. And they eat crab eggs and fish heads.
The highlight, aside from encountering &amp;ldquo;Hot Pot&amp;rdquo; for the first time was visiting the national Panda zoo!</description>

      <description>Kathmandu #      Himalayas / Everest #  We didn&amp;rsquo;t make it to the summit, we didn&amp;rsquo;t even try. We chartered a helicopter to near base camp. Including the flight into Lukla airport, considered by many to be the most dangerous in the world.

      <description>Istanbul #  Our last stop before all going our separate ways was in Istanbul. Highlight of that visit for me was the Hagia Sophia, once the tallest structure in the world and certainly one of the oldest still standing. There is a lot of history, including that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t officially called Istanbul until 1930. But I&amp;rsquo;ll let you google for the history. I&amp;rsquo;m just here to brag with photographic evidence that I&amp;rsquo;ve been there (although in this case it appears I don&amp;rsquo;t actually make an appearance in my own photos).</description>

      <description>Europe Part 3 - Belgium #  Brussels #  I was only in Belgium for one night, but I had a lot of fun. I stayed in Brussels. It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful city, of course. Birthplace of Audrey Hepburn, location of an escape room I nearly had a chance to try and escape from except for the drunk northern irish couple I met and hung with until the girl puked everywhere and gave me 50 euros for some reason.</description>

      <description>Dublin #  You best believe I made a stop in the city where I started my 6 week backpacking trip in 2016. Dublin! Another favorite. I wish I could live dozens of lives so I could truly soak in the beauty, history, and culture of every city on this trip. Not least of all, Dublin.
I stayed in an historic hotel that, with its winding halls and unpredictable layout, reminded me of &amp;ldquo;House of Leaves&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>New York #  I had about a 6 hour layover in JFK. Didn&amp;rsquo;t take many pictures. But I ate a lot of seafood and drank a lot of beer.
Home #  Back in Salt Lake, I celebrated by singing karaoke and showing people my shoes (for some reason.)
   Of Particular note is how only a few days after I got home, I met an amazing Chinese woman and we began dating seriously shortly after that.</description>

      <title>Chess and Incompleteness</title>

      <description>Chess and Logic #  Chess and Logic, huh?
There&amp;rsquo;s something fundamental linking them, and I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about using logic to beat a game of chess. The rules of chess are similar to the axioms of a logical system. This got me thinking, can we demonstrate Kurt Gödel&amp;rsquo;s incompleteness theorem in chess?
If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar (and it&amp;rsquo;s a large and difficult territory should you decide to venture there), the incompleteness theorem says that &amp;ldquo;logic systems can describe true statements that can not be derived using that system&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I recently got stoned for the first time in several years with Caleen. Whoa buddy. Like no time had passed at all. Instantly back where I was when I was a 24/7 stoner (about from 2007 to 2015).
I thought I might try to write about what it&amp;rsquo;s like for me. I think everyone&amp;rsquo;s experience is distinct, like a fingerprint of your soul. Caleen and I talked about it a little bit.</description>

      <description>EDIT: This blog is now hosted using Hugo, not Jekyll. I have to find a way to migrate what I&amp;rsquo;ve described here.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had this blog for many years, and basically never posted anything. I wanted to become better about that, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing more haikus and trying to write up some of my home projects. My blog uses Jekyll and is hosted on Github Pages which already makes it pretty easy to write content but I wanted to see if I could make it even easier.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently taken on the task of setting up my YubiKeys for usage beyond 2 factor auth. Something I learned was that OpenPGP smartcards (which include YubiKeys) have slots for three separate keys: Signature, Encryption, and Authentication.
My first goal is to sign git commits with it. Because I am a man of negligible importance, this is in fact NOT an excercise in security. I&amp;rsquo;m taking more of a hobbyist approach.</description>

      <description>First a little background #  I had a couple old NAS storage solutions I pulled out of, well, my storage unit a while back. Tried to set them up in my office and found them to be really difficult to use, but the data on them is still good. So I pulled the disks out and decided to look into upgrading to something newer. After some research, I concluded the existing out-of-the-box solutions available are overpriced for what they offer.</description>
