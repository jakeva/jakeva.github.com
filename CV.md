Visualizations
-------------

+ Historical Climate Data

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/YFdnqXrvwv0" frameborder="0"> </iframe>
This video shows the historical climate record of Earth. Early on in the record there are very few stations reporting data, but by the mid-20th century Earth's temperature was being measured almost ubiquitously. It was my goal to visualize this record. One of the key things I noticed by doing this was that while stations near the equator tended to report pretty much near the average temperatures, stations in the more extreme parts of the hemispheres report much warmer than average temperatures. This is true year round, but especially during the colder months. Keep an eye out for the large blue spheres mixed in with average sized red spheres.

This was done in Python using VTK. Source code is available [here](https://github.com/jakeva/Historical-Climate-Visualization). (Also, if you like the music, that was my work too.)
