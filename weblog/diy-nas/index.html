<a class=anchor href=#first-a-little-background>#</a></h2><p>I had a couple old NAS storage solutions I pulled out of, well, my storage unit a while back. Tried to set them up in my office and found them to be really difficult to use, but the data on them is still good. So I pulled the disks out and decided to look into upgrading to something newer. After some research, I concluded the existing out-of-the-box solutions available are overpriced for what they offer. I decided I wanted more control over the parts to reduce cost, as well as having more freedom in setting up the server software so I looked into building my own.</p><h2 id=parts>Parts
<a class=anchor href=#parts>#</a></h2><p>I used <a href=https://pcpartpicker.com>PC Partpicker</a> to help me narrow down what I was looking for. I went in blind hoping I&rsquo;d find a tower suitable for what I wanted, and I think I found the perfect one. Everything else was selected to fit it.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Part</th><th>Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href=https://pcpartpicker.com/product/yTdqqs/fractal-design-case-fdcanode804blw>Fractal Design Node 804 MicroATX Mid Tower Case</a></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>This is particularly recommended for a NAS build. Both on Amazon and Newegg, reviews were a bit mixed but for a little over $100 I decided I could handle a few imperfections. Right now I have 7 3.5" drives ranging from 1 to 4 TB, and 1 2.5" SSD I want to use as the boot disk. Between disk bay utilization and cooling options, this tower promises some pretty interesting flexibility. In their own words, it has a &ldquo;Unique hard drive mounting system, fitting up to 8 x 3.5&rdquo;, 4 x 2.5" or up to 10 x 3.5", 2 x 2.5" drives HDD/SSD" all inside a 13.5 x 12 x 15.3in package. That&rsquo;s 12 slots for hard drives! That should fit my needs perfectly with plenty of room for future upgrades and fit nicely under my desk.</td><td>$109.99</td></tr><tr><td><a href=https://pcpartpicker.com/product/RkJtt6/amd-ryzen-3-2200g-35ghz-quad-core-processor-yd2200c5fbbox>AMD Ryzen 3 2200G 3.5 GHz Quad-Core Processor</a></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>At first I was just interested in picking up a 2 core CPU since I intend on doing nothing with this machine except serving up files to my home network. I&rsquo;m the only user, so I don&rsquo;t need much CPU. However, I found it tricky to pair up a 2 core CPU with a motherboard so I just picked a reasonable quad core. It might be a little over kill, but that&rsquo;s ok.</td><td>$107.68</td></tr><tr><td>I had more trouble finding the right motherboard. I ordered a cheap one early on, forgetting to check how many SATA slots it had. What I ordered was the <a href=https://pcpartpicker.com/product/RD97YJ/asrock-b450m-hdv-r40-micro-atx-am4-motherboard-b450m-hdv-r40>ASRock B450M-HDV R4.0 Micro ATX AM4 Motherboard</a></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>which comes with 4 SATA 6 Gb/s slots. That won&rsquo;t be enough, but for the price, I can slap some extra slots in with theâ€¦</td><td>$69.97</td></tr><tr><td><a href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07S8CB398/>Ziyituod SATA3.0 Card</a></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>6 SATA 6 Gb/s PCIe controller. Problem solved.</td><td>$39.95</td></tr><tr><td><a href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019FRDFU0>Crucial 4GB Single DDR4</a></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Like I don&rsquo;t need much processing power, I don&rsquo;t need much ram. Two sticks of 4 GB DDR4 should do it.</td><td>$39.98</td></tr><tr><td><a href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KVNCEIG>be Quiet! Pure Rock Slim - CPU Cooler</a></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>A concern I had was how loud this thing was going to be. I picked a CPU cooler that promises it gets no louder than 25 Db. The fans that come with the tower might be a different story, but I can worry about those later if it&rsquo;s an issue. Anyway, this thing is pretty cheap too.</td><td>$33.28</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://www.newegg.com/evga-supernova-850-g2-220-g2-0850-xr-850w/p/N82E16817438018?Item=N82E16817438018">EVGA SuperNOVA 800W</a></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>And the final piece is the power supply. Need enough power for up to ten drives, so here we are.</td><td>$159.99</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This brings the total to a little over $500. By comparison you can get an <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Synology-Bay-Diskstation-Diskless-DS1819/dp/B07KMKDW42/>8 bay NAS by Synology</a> for $931.</p><h2 id=now-i-wait>Now I wait
<a class=anchor href=#now-i-wait>#</a></h2><p>I haven&rsquo;t got all the parts yet, but I&rsquo;ll post an update when I get it built and have a chance to play with it. I expect there will be some tradeoffs, like the interior will probably be a bit cramped and hard to work with. Maybe it will get a little hot or loud with the four fans. But I&rsquo;m excited, I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be able to find a solution that would fit 10 drives in around a square foot of floor space. At less than $500, for me it&rsquo;s a no brainer.</p><h2 id=and-whats-next>And what&rsquo;s next?
<a class=anchor href=#and-whats-next>#</a></h2><p>Of course, I&rsquo;m already thinking down the road. Right now I only have a little over 12 TBs of hard drives ready to put to use (consisting mostly of Bluray backups and music), but at $485 for a <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-IronWolf-16TB-Internal-Drive/dp/B07SGGWYC1>16 TB Drive</a> I am imagining a world where I spend a small fortune for a +13x increase and while I&rsquo;ll probably never need it, it is pretty fun to imagine.</p><h2 id=small-update>Small Update
<a class=anchor href=#small-update>#</a></h2><p>Ok so I bought two of the 16 TB drives intending to get a simple mirror up. Funny story, I snapped the plastic on the sata connector of one of them trying to fit it into the case. It is pretty tight in there. Anyway, I bought a third to replace it. But by the time it arrived I decided it was worth trying to salvage the broken one. The pins were still there and I had the broken off plastic piece, so I sort of put it back together delicately and slid it all back in. It worked! The system connected to the drive and now I&rsquo;ve got a healthy 32 TB Raid Z1 pool running in my FreeNAS!</p><p>I&rsquo;m working now on setting up torrenting over OpenVPN among other things. I&rsquo;ll write some of that up in separate blog posts.</p></p></article><script src=https://utteranc.es/client.js repo=m3ta4a/m3ta4a.github.io issue-term=pathname theme=github-dark crossorigin=anonymous async></script><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#first-a-little-background>First a little background</a></li><li><a href=#parts>Parts</a></li><li><a href=#now-i-wait>Now I wait</a></li><li><a href=#and-whats-next>And what&rsquo;s next?</a></li><li><a href=#small-update>Small Update</a></li></ul></nav></aside></main></body></html>
