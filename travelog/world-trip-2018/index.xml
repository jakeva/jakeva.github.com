We chartered a helicopter to near base camp. Including the flight into Lukla airport, considered by many to be the most dangerous in the world.</description></item><item><title>Istanbul, Turkey</title><link>https://m3ta4a.io/travelog/world-trip-2018/turkey/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://m3ta4a.io/travelog/world-trip-2018/turkey/</guid><description>Istanbul # Our last stop before all going our separate ways was in Istanbul. Highlight of that visit for me was the Hagia Sophia, once the tallest structure in the world and certainly one of the oldest still standing. There is a lot of history, including that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t officially called Istanbul until 1930. But I&amp;rsquo;ll let you google for the history. I&amp;rsquo;m just here to brag with photographic evidence that I&amp;rsquo;ve been there (although in this case it appears I don&amp;rsquo;t actually make an appearance in my own photos).</description></item><item><title>Dublin, Ireland</title><link>https://m3ta4a.io/travelog/world-trip-2018/ireland/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://m3ta4a.io/travelog/world-trip-2018/ireland/</guid><description>Dublin # You best believe I made a stop in the city where I started my 6 week backpacking trip in 2016. Dublin! Another favorite. I wish I could live dozens of lives so I could truly soak in the beauty, history, and culture of every city on this trip. Not least of all, Dublin.
I stayed in an historic hotel that, with its winding halls and unpredictable layout, reminded me of &amp;ldquo;House of Leaves&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>New York, and Home</title><link>https://m3ta4a.io/travelog/world-trip-2018/new-york-and-home/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://m3ta4a.io/travelog/world-trip-2018/new-york-and-home/</guid><description>New York # I had about a 6 hour layover in JFK. Didn&amp;rsquo;t take many pictures. But I ate a lot of seafood and drank a lot of beer.
Home # Back in Salt Lake, I celebrated by singing karaoke and showing people my shoes (for some reason.)
Of Particular note is how only a few days after I got home, I met an amazing Chinese woman and we began dating seriously shortly after that.</description></item></channel></rss>
