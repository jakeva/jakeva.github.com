Bookmarks
---------

Two questions: What browser do you use? How many browsers do you use? Well, unless (or even if) you're a web developer or a power user, you likely keep your bookmarks with your favorite browser. That's what I did for the longest time, and it worked too, because I was using Chrome and at the time it was the only browser to let you sign in and instantly have all your stuff. I could go to school, login to Chrome (after installing it) and have every bookmark.

Then one day, Safari came out with a new version. *And it was better than Chrome.* So I was in a pickle. The new version was fantastic, but what about my bookmarks? Well I did what everyone does: I imported them into Safari. Groovy. But then I stupidly decided to add a bookmark. What browser was I in? 

I quickly came to the realization that my bookmarking system was deeply flawed. My bookmarks easily fell out of sync (I also use Firefox regularly, of course). This became an enormous headache for me, because WHERE THE **** DID I SAVE THAT BOOKMARK I'M LOOKING FOR RIGHT THE **** NOW? 

Bookmarking is intended to obviate remembering: *if I have to remember where I saved my bookmark, how does that solve the problem of not having to remember where the site I want is located?* It doesn't. It's a trade-off of one problem for another identical (well, maybe simplified) one. I needed another solution.

My criteria included the ability to quickly drill down to my targeted bookmark using at most a few relevant tags, and have a single point of access so I only have one thing to remember, regardless of platform or machine I'm on.

Initially, I did some searching and settled on [XMarks](http://www.xmarks.com). Let me tell you something... *it almost worked*. I was very near satisfaction, until the syncing process duplicated all my bookmarks in one of my browsers, and deleted them all from another. Maybe I screwed up the setup, but if it's that easy to screw up, it doesn't solve the problem either.

I gave it another few shots, but in the end, XMarks was not my knight in shining armor. Maybe it is for some people. For me, it was worse than the problem it was supposed to solve.

So what works for me? [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in), that's what. For about 10$, up front and non-recurring, you get an online repository for your bookmarks. For about 25$ a year (including the first 10), they'll save off a webcrawled copy for you, so if your bookmarked site is taken offline, you still have it. This is MY solution. I keep all my bookmarks private, but it does have some pretty cool sharing features. You can see what other people you're connected to are bookmarking, and copy those into your own if you like. It's like an internet smorgasbord.

I 'innovated' one last piece myself, though. After moving all my bookmarks to Pinboard, I deleted everything from my browsers. Then, I set up an efficient and small system on each of my browsers. A couple of static folders on the bookmark bar of each browser for the most indispensible links, including a dumping ground where everything is queued up to be added into my Pinboard account, which I do periodically.

Now, when I find a webpage I think I want to bookmark, I bookmark it to the toolbar folder of the browser I'm in-- doesn't matter which. This way, I don't needlessly clutter up my Pinboard with junk links, I save the ones I want. Then, when I have time to go through them, I add them to Pinboard and remove them from the toolbar. This yields the effect of using browser bookmarks as a sort of quality control queue into my Pinboard collection.

Of course, truly *awesome* links just go straight in. :P
