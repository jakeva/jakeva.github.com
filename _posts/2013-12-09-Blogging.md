Blogging
============
And not blogging
-------------------

I see a great analogy for software in the world of music. Sometimes people have this attitude that all the software or hardware people could need has already been built, or that all anyone is doing these days is pasting together existing libraries. I'm staggered by the underestimation of the power of creativity. After all, in music there's only 12 notes in a scale, and there's only a few beats that matter, and whatever your taste, incredible new music is always coming out.

Forget it. In the world of software there is nothing but infinitudes of possibility, and nothing but time to explore it. Not enough time, but there you have it. Software is for business, for families, but ultimately software is for *people*. If people are using it, that's awesome and maybe that's enough for some, but it's not enough for me. I want my users to *love* using it.

I do have interesting things to say from time to time, and I may write some down but forgive me if I don't write much. I'm probably busy coding something I hope you'll like.
