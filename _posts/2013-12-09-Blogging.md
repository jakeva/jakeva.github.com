Blogging
-------------------

Blogging really isn't my objective-- writing code is.

I see a great analogy for software in the world of music. Sometimes people have this attitude that all the software or hardware people could need has already been built, and I'm staggered by the underestimation of the power of creativity. After all, in the world of music, isn't everybody stuck with the same 12 chromatic notes in a scale? There's only, what, 4 or 5 different beats anyone listens to, so it's all been done, right?

Forget it, man. In the world of software there is nothing but infinitudes of possibility, and nothing but time to explore it. Not enough time, but there you have it. Software is for businesses, for families, but ultimately software is for *people*. If people are using it, maybe that's enough for some, but it's not enough for me. I want my users to *love* using it. I want to hear you love it for the simplicity it has brought to you life. I want my software to make you smile.

I do have interesting things to say from time to time, and I may write some down but forgive me if I don't write much. I'm probably busy writing code.
