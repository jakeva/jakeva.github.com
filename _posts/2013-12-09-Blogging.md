Blogging
-------------------

Blogging really isn't my objective-- writing code is. Ideally, people will like the results of the code I write, but my primary objective is truly in service to the creation of beautiful and useable software.

I see a great analogy for software in the world of music. Sometimes people have this attitude that all the software or hardware people could need has already been built, and I'm staggered by the underestimation of the power of creativity. After all, in the world of music, isn't everybody stuck with the same 12 chromatic notes in a scale? There's only, what, 4 or 5 different beats anyone listens to, so it's all been done, right?

Forget it, man. In the world of software there is nothing but infinitudes of possibility, and nothing but time to explore it. Not enough time, but there you have it. Software is for businesses, for families, but ultimately software is for *people*. If people are using it, maybe that's enough for you, but it's not enough for me. I want those people to express gratitude to me for the simplicity I've brought to their life. I want my software to make you smile.

So, forgive me if I don't write many posts after this. I'm probably busy writing code.
