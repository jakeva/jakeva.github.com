GitHub Pages
============
Jekyll Static Sites
-------------------

This is pretty awesome. I know I'm behind the curve a little because Jekyll has been around for a while, but I have been redesigning my online presence and discovered this system for hosting my own blog. Now, I've had some number of blogs I never updated and I really don't know if I'm going to update this one. But I'm impressed by the power of Jekyll for producing web content. I really like the idea of hitting "rake post" in Terminal to autogenerate the template automagically. And publishing is just a git push away. Normally I use <a href="http://panic.com/coda/">Coda 2</a> and a <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/getting-started.html">bootstrap</a> template, but I was born on the command line and I tend to prefer living there. With Jekyll, I can edit the source code in <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 2</a> and with an instance of Jekyll running in server mode set to auto-regenerate shows the compiled website in my browser.
