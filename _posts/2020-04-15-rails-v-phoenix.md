fwiw I think I now have roughly the same amount of experience in both rails and phoenix which doesn't by any means make me an expert pro with blog worthy opinions, but I do think I slightly prefer elixir/phx. I've started a handful of side projects recently and I keep finding myself starting them with elixir. I think I just 'get it' better, maybe the magic of rails makes it hard to feel that way for me.

or maybe it was that i learned rails first and learning phx second made it a gentler learning curve
