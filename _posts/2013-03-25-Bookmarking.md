Bookmarks
---------

Bookmarks used to be so easy for me. How? I never used them, that's how. All that changed a few years ago, however. Now I've got over 500 bookmarks, and not one of them is dispensable. I couldn't say what changed, exactly, just that suddenly I started bookmarking every stupid little scrap of information that I knew I'd want again.

Many people have vastly more bookmarks than I do, from a cursory read through just about any forum discussing the topic. I can't imagine how they get that many, but then again I'm not really such a net addict. My collection is modest, but essential. There are no bookmarks to google.com, or to expedia.com. Why would I want those? The links are clearly easily accessible with my brain and my fingers have yet to forbid me typing the URL out. I like to type, but that's another topic.

The number of bookmarks a person has is only one part of the problem. How many browsers do you use? Well, whatever your answer, unless you're a web developer or power user, you likely keep your bookmarks with your favorite browser. That's what I did in the beginning too, when I finally started bookmarking. It worked too, because I was using Chrome and at the time it was the only browser to let you sign in and instantly have all your shit. I could go to school, login in to Chrome (after installing it) and have every single bookmark I had ever bookmarked.

Then one day, Safari came out with a cool little feature called the Omnibar. They didn't invent it, and Chrome had long since adopted such a novel idea, but I work off a Macbook Pro and I'll be damned if I don't give Apple's software the first opportunity to win me over. Especially a new version.

The new version was fantastic, but you guessed it, what about my bookmarks? Well I did what everyone does: I imported them into Safari. Groovy. But then, one day, I had the gall to add a bookmark. What browser was I in? I don't recall, but this is the order of things that brought me to the realization that my bookmarking system was flawed. My bookmarks quickly fell out of sync (I also use Firefox regularly, are you surprised?). This became an enormous headache for me, because WHERE THE FUCK DID I SAVE THAT BOOKMARK I'M LOOKING FOR RIGHT THE FUCK NOW? Bookmarking is supposed to remove the need to remember. So this wasn't working for me. An obvious solution is to look through the bookmarks of each browser you use, but this was an unacceptable use of time for me and it defeats the purpose of bookmarking.

At the time, I did some searching and settled on [XMarks](http://www.xmarks.com). Let me tell you something... *it almost worked*. I was so near satisfaction, until the syncing process duplicated all my bookmarks in one of my browsers, and deleted them all from another. Maybe I fucked up the setup, but if it's possible for a user to fuck up setting up, it doesn't solve the problem as I see it.

I gave it another few shots, but in the end, XMarks was not my knight in shining armor.

So what was? [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in), that's what. For about 10 bucks, up front and non-recurring, you get an online repository for your bookmarks. For 15$ a year (I believe), they'll save off a webcrawled copy for you, so if your bookmarked site is taken offline, you still have it. This is MY solution.

I innovated one last piece myself, though. After moving all my bookmarks to Pinboard, I deleted every last one from my browsers. Then, I set up a single folder in each containing no more than ten of my most important, including Pinboard.

Now, when I find a webpage I want to bookmark, I bookmark it to the toolbar folder of the browser I'm in. This way, I don't needlessly clutter up my Pinboard with junk links, I save the ones I want. Then, when I have time to go through them, I add them to Pinboard and remove them from the toolbar. This yields the effect of using browser bookmarks as a sort of quality control queue into my Pinboard collection.

And using bookmarks has never made me more happy.
