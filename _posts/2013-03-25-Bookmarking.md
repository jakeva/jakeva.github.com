Bookmarks
---------

Bookmarks used to be so easy for me. How? I never used them, that's how. All that changed a few years ago, however. Now I've got over 500 bookmarks (not really that many..), and each is meticulously organized and tagged. Why it took me so long is a mystery.

Many people have vastly more bookmarks than I do, from a cursory look online. I can't imagine how they get that many, but then again I'm not really as much a net addict as many other people. My collection is modest, but essential.

The number of bookmarks a person has is only one part of the problem. How many browsers do you use? Well, whatever your answer, unless you're a web developer or power user, you likely keep your bookmarks with your favorite browser. That's what I did in the beginning too, when I finally started bookmarking. It worked too, because I was using Chrome and at the time it was the only browser to let you sign in and instantly have all your shit. I could go to school, login in to Chrome (after installing it) and have every single bookmark I had ever bookmarked.

Then one day, Safari came out with a new version.

The new version was fantastic, but you guessed it, what about my bookmarks? Well I did what everyone does: I imported them into Safari. Groovy. But then, one day, I had the nerve to add a bookmark. What browser was I in? I don't recall, but this is what brought me to the realization that my bookmarking system was deeply flawed. My bookmarks quickly fell out of sync (I also use Firefox regularly, of course). This became an enormous headache for me, because WHERE THE FUCK DID I SAVE THAT BOOKMARK I'M LOOKING FOR RIGHT THE FUCK NOW? Bookmarking is intended to obviate remembering. So this wouldn't work for me.

At the time, I did some searching and settled on [XMarks](http://www.xmarks.com). Let me tell you something... *it almost worked*. I was so near satisfaction, until the syncing process duplicated all my bookmarks in one of my browsers, and deleted them all from another. Maybe I fucked up the setup, but if it's possible  to fuck up setting it up, it doesn't solve the problem either.

I gave it another few shots, but in the end, XMarks was not my knight in shining armor. Maybe it is for some people. For me, it was worse than the problem it was supposed to solve.

So what works for me? [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in), that's what. For about 10 bucks, up front and non-recurring, you get an online repository for your bookmarks. For 15$ a year (I believe), they'll save off a webcrawled copy for you, so if your bookmarked site is taken offline, you still have it. This is MY solution.

I innovated one last piece myself, though. After moving all my bookmarks to Pinboard, I deleted every last one from my browsers. Then, I set up a single folder in each containing no more than ten of my most important, including Pinboard.

Now, when I find a webpage I think I want to bookmark, I bookmark it to the toolbar folder of the browser I'm in. This way, I don't needlessly clutter up my Pinboard with junk links, I save the ones I want. Then, when I have time to go through them, I add them to Pinboard and remove them from the toolbar. This yields the effect of using browser bookmarks as a sort of quality control queue into my Pinboard collection.

Of course, *awesome* links just go straight in. :P

And using bookmarks has never made me more happy.
