My Tools
========
Since every developer seems to have one, I threw together a list of tools I've been using. There is a wide gap between the best and the worst software, even behind Apple's walled garden. I loathe bad software, and I am continually searching for a better way to do things. My favorite tools are the ones that don't fall in and out of favor, but rather remain perpetually opened on my desktop because I use them so often. It is important to me that an app have aesthetic appeal. This includes the icon, but a bad icon is no disqualifer. I also pretty much just use Mac OS X if I can help it. As far as Windows goes, my list is [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org) and [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com).

The first tool I'll mention is the impressive [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2). Every developer needs to have their go to text editor. For many years, mine was Emacs and it will always be vital, but we live in the modern era and while it is feature rich and magnificently extensible, Emacs is far from a modern tool. Sublime Text is modern, fresh and it is deep like Emacs. I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of this thing. The overall design is impeccable, although the icon is... well, there's worse. My favorite surprise feature on opening it up was to see a scrollable miniview of the document I'm editing, similar to what you can get with PowerTools in Visual Studio. Since purchasing a copy, I've been slowly accumulating various plugins. I was able to configure switching between XeTex and LaTex for compiling LaTex documents with just a quick shortcut. A number of the other things I tuned it for I was able to get out of other text editors as well, but I'm most impressed with Sublime Text's approach to things. It's very Linux-like, if I may say so. It introduces a few features I haven't seen before, such as column selection. Anyway, it's worth checking out if you aren't already familiar. I used [TextMate](http://macromates.com) for a few years, and I enjoyed its customizability. I was easily able to set up build scripts for all the languages I used it for, but it hasn't been supported or updated in some time. The long awaited version 2 has been [open sourced](http://blog.macromates.com/2012/textmate-2-at-github/), and it's worth checking out. I've dabbled with [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html?utm_source=thedeck&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=bbedit) (Uh, yes, it certainly _doesn't suck_) which I understand is a classic favorite, but it never gained a lot of traction with me. Nice icon though.

Of course, then there's [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). Anyone who develops on a Mac knows Xcode, so it's not really worth mentioning, but I do spend the vast majority of my time in it, so it would be an incomplete list without it. I recently started using [AppCode](http://www.jetbrains.com/objc/) as well, I've found it makes an excellent compliment to Xcode. It's refactoring abilities alone surpass those of Xcode by enough to make it worth checking out.

I do Web Development as well, mainly for myself. Most of my web work has been with static content, and for that my IDE of choice is [Coda 2](http://panic.com/coda/). It's fantastic in a lot of ways. It includes a compete digital library of web technologies, as well as providing a modern interface with an innovative approach to tabbing, which does a surprisingly good job of reducing the overhead involved in handling any number of open web design files.

I only recently discovered [FlyCut](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flycut-clipboard-manager/id442160987?mt=12) which is a little depressing, because while it is new within the last few years, it's forked from an older open source project and I didn't know about either. All this time, my copies and cuts were just being thrown away with each new one. Oh well. It's perfect for developers. Upon launching the app, it keeps track of the contents of your clipboard. You activate the app's floating window by hitting Shift-CMD-V, which shows you a preview of the text at the top of your copy stack. You can cycle through your history, and paste the item you select. The preview window is brilliant, you can know at a glance what you're about to paste and cycling feels zippy. It's a fast, unbloated little piece of software, and I'm impressed.

I've been using Oleg Andreev's [GitBox](http://gitboxapp.com) for a while now. Git can be a little unwieldy, and this app does a remarkable job of simplifying it for you. Granted, I've still encountered situations which required some finely tuned command line surgery but most common tasks you need it for (committing, cloning, etc) are just a few keyboad taps with GitBox. Highly Recommended.

[Kaleidoscope 2](http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com) is another really excellent tool. It replaces FileMerge, and gladly. FileMerge is an effective little utility as well, but it is brutal on the eyes. Kaleidoscope isn't just a pleasure to work with, it's loaded with power I don't know that I'll ever need. Just the way I like it. :) Not only does it have a number of visually pleasing modes for viewing file differences, but it includes the ability to view differences between folders and even between images, which I'm not sure I've seen before. Kaleidoscope 2 also includes the ability to merge, something I recall its predecessor frustratingly lacked.

I like to keep track of my time, and I've tried a few tools here too. The one I like the most is [Timing](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/timing-time-tracking-for-humans/id431511738?mt=12). It's another one of those apps you launch automatically when you login, and you never think about it and it never gets in your way until you need it. And when you do, you're happy to realize it has faithfully tracked the amount of time you've spent in the various applications and projects that you've set up. Not only that, but it presents the data effectively so you get a sense of where you're spending (or wasting...) your time effectively and efficiently. Great little timing tool.

[Hazel](http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php) is an effective tool that enables you to set up rules for folders. This is similar to Apple's Folder actions in Finder, but with a great deal of added power. It even replaces app removal apps I've been a fan of in the past, like my previous favorite [AppZapper](http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/20306/appzapper) which might still be cheaper, if that's all you want. The few default rules were enough to convince me I wanted to pay full price, however, as they do things like mark new downloads with Apple's blue highlight in Finder, and mark files in the downloads folder that have been there longer than a week red to indicate that they're old. For me, that spawned a whole bunch of ideas for automating and simplifying the process of keeping my computer organized the way I like. Hazel saves me a lot of time these days. Excellent app.

From time to time I do design work. I think I'm pretty good at it, but I don't think of it as my first job. Still, I've been collecting tools that aid me in getting the design right. First, [xScope](http://xscopeapp.com/features). xScope is like a digital set of precision surgical equipment. There's a floating Loupe, a set of rulers, auto-snapping dimensions (this one is cool in action), among others. It's a snappy little utility, I really like it.

For screen captures and snapping web pages, I've tried a number of apps (including [LittleSnapper](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/littlesnapper/)) but they never seemed to work right. LittleSnapper seemed buggy to me and besides, the interface seemed dated. What I've settled on is [Voila](http://www.globaldelight.com/voila/mac-screen-capture-overview.html), which has proven itself to be a versatile and complete screen capture and annotation tool. It has an impressive track record, I was surprised I hadn't heard of it sooner.

For all those random little icons you always need, whether you're replacing Apple's stock icons or need original icons, I've found [Art Text 2](http://www.belightsoft.com/products/arttext/overview.php) to be a great deal of help in getting me some sweet looking icons quickly. There are a ton of built in shapes, patterns, and textures, and the level of customizability is impressive. If not for this app, I'd probably have already spent many times its cost on custom icons from designers. The app itself isn't designed particularly well, but it works and it's been a reliable tool for me for over a year now.

And finally, for quickly producing all the iOS icons I need, the best tool I've found is [Iconizer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iconizer/id412346451?mt=12). I've tried about a dozen different variations of these icon generators, and it's been a little hit and miss.  If you want to layer ribbons and "On Sale" decals over your icon, Iconizer doesn't include those features. It simply accepts an icon image and generates all the various iOS icons, from the full 1024x1024 on down to the iPhone spotlight icon at 29x29. It creates the gloss appearance if you want, and there's an option to view each icon in context. Simple, effective. The best kind of tool.

Wrap up

Okay, so that's what I'm using these days. I use a lot of software, and this list was influenced by the amount of use, so

Having a set of cool tools makes you cool. Trust me, I'm a doctor.

PS, I am not a doctor.
