GitHub Pages
============
Jekyll Static Sites
-------------------

I have been redesigning my online presence and discovered <a href="http://pages.github.com/">this system</a> for hosting a blog on GitHub. It makes a lot of sense to host my blog about development on the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/78991/why-is-github-more-popular-than-gitorious">best repository on the web</a>. Now, I've had some number of blogs I never updated and I really don't know if I'm going to update this one (which I guess means: don't count on it. Blogging really isn't my objective; writing code is.). With that said, I am impressed by the power of Jekyll for producing web content. I really like being able to hit "rake post" in Terminal to autogenerate the template automagically. And publishing is literally just a git push away. Normally I use <a href="http://panic.com/coda/">Coda 2</a> and a <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/getting-started.html">bootstrap</a> template, but I was born on the command line and I tend to prefer living there. With Jekyll, I can edit the source code in <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 2</a> and with an instance of Jekyll running in server mode set to auto-regenerate shows the compiled website in my browser. 

Like I said, I don't do a lot of (English) writing, but I think I'm at least satisfied enough that if or when I do have something to say and throw out there, I won't be distracted by trying to fix the awful system I was using before. Jekyll rocks, I recommend it with thumbs up and all that.
