<p>I had a couple old NAS storage solutions I pulled out of, well, my storage unit a while back. Tried to set them up in my office and found them to be really difficult to use, but the data on them is still good. So I pulled the disks out and decided to look into upgrading to something newer. After some research, I concluded the existing out-of-the-box solutions available are overpriced for what they offer. I decided I wanted more control over the parts to reduce cost, as well as having more freedom in setting up the server software so I looked into building my own.</p>

<h2 id="parts">Parts</h2>
<p>I used <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com">PC Partpicker</a> to help me narrow down what I was looking for. I went in blind hoping I’d find a tower suitable for what I wanted, and I think I found the perfect one. Everything else was selected to fit it.</p>

      <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/product/yTdqqs/fractal-design-case-fdcanode804blw">Fractal Design Node 804 MicroATX Mid Tower Case</a>
      <p>This is particularly recommended for a NAS build. Both on Amazon and Newegg, reviews were a bit mixed but for a little over $100 I decided I could handle a few imperfections. Right now I have 7 3.5" drives ranging from 1 to 4 TB, and 1 2.5" SSD I want to use as the boot disk. Between disk bay utilization and cooling options, this tower promises some pretty interesting flexibility. In their own words, it has a "Unique hard drive mounting system, fitting up to 8 x 3.5", 4 x 2.5" or up to 10 x 3.5", 2 x 2.5" drives HDD/SSD" all inside a 13.5 x 12 x 15.3in package. That's 12 slots for hard drives! That should fit my needs perfectly with plenty of room for future upgrades and fit nicely under my desk.</p>

      <p>At first I was just interested in picking up a 2 core CPU since I intend on doing nothing with this machine except serving up files to my home network. I'm the only user, so I don't need much CPU. However, I found it tricky to pair up a 2 core CPU with a motherboard so I just picked a reasonable quad core. It might be a little over kill, but that's ok.</p>

      <p>A concern I had was how loud this thing was going to be. I picked a CPU cooler that promises it gets no louder than 25 Db. The fans that come with the tower might be a different story, but I can worry about those later if it's an issue. Anyway, this thing is pretty cheap too.</p>

<p>This brings the total to a little over $500. By comparison you can get an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Synology-Bay-Diskstation-Diskless-DS1819/dp/B07KMKDW42/">8 bay NAS by Synology</a> for $931.</p>

<h2 id="now-i-wait">Now I wait</h2>
<p>I haven’t got all the parts yet, but I’ll post an update when I get it built and have a chance to play with it. I expect there will be some tradeoffs, like the interior will probably be a bit cramped and hard to work with. Maybe it will get a little hot or loud with the four fans. But I’m excited, I didn’t think I’d be able to find a solution that would fit 10 drives in around a square foot of floor space. At less than $500, for me it’s a no brainer.</p>

<h2 id="and-whats-next">And what’s next?</h2>
<p>Of course, I’m already thinking down the road. Right now I only have a little over 12 TBs of hard drives ready to put to use (consisting mostly of Bluray backups and music), but at $485 for a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-IronWolf-16TB-Internal-Drive/dp/B07SGGWYC1">16 TB Drive</a> I am imagining a world where I spend a small fortune for a +13x increase and while I’ll probably never need it, it is pretty fun to imagine.</p>

<h1 id="small-update">Small Update</h1>
<p>Ok so I bought two of the 16 TB drives intending to get a simple mirror up. Funny story, I snapped the plastic on the sata connector of one of them trying to fit it into the case. It is pretty tight in there. Anyway, I bought a third to replace it. But by the time it arrived I decided it was worth trying to salvage the broken one. The pins were still there and I had the broken off plastic piece, so I sort of put it back together delicately and slid it all back in. It worked! The system connected to the drive and now I’ve got a healthy 32 TB Raid Z1 pool running in my FreeNAS!</p>

<p>I’m working now on setting up torrenting over OpenVPN among other things. I’ll write some of that up in separate blog posts.</p>
