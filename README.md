My Jekyll powered GitHub homepage.

Because every time I go to do something with this, I forget how it all worksâ€¦ here's how it all works:

Stylesheets are generated from assets/themes/hooligan/_sass but must be generated locally (GitHub doesn't do any scss processing, just Jekyll)

so, rake hooligan && rake preview

That's pretty much it.
